# 1. Computer-Vision---Affine-Transformation
Affine Transformation OpenCV implementation

Code to perform these operations:
(1) Get the input image.
(2) Decrease its size by half
(3) Rotate 30 degrees
(4) Translate 5 pixels towards the left and to the bottom
(5) Save the result.

What is an Affine Transformation?
A transformation that can be expressed in the form of a matrix multiplication (linear transformation) followed by a vector addition (translation).

From the above, we can use an Affine Transformation to express:
1. Rotations (linear transformation)
2. Translations (vector addition)
3. Scale operations (linear transformation)

you can see that, in essence, an Affine Transformation represents a relation between two images.

# 2. Computer-Vision---Gaussian Filter
Filter types
1. Mean filter (box)
2. Weighted mean
3. Gaussian
